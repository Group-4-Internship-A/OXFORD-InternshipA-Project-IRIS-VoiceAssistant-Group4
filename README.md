# OXFORD-InternshipA-Project-IRIS-VoiceAssistant-Group4
The primary project that I, Rithvik, worked on during this internship is an AI driven voice assistant called IRIS. We explored several latent aspects of python to successfully build IRIS. As the group leader, I also refined my leadership skills by co-ordinating, guiding, and working with a diverse team.

IRIS features a plethora of functionalities you can vocally trigger. This application has a special emphasis on the not-so-tech-savvy demographic, such as the old-aged, or visually impaired. IRIS helps bridge the gap inherent between specialized demographics in the technological domain, and the novice demographic, subsequently contributing to an automated way of life, that we are bound to transition to.
